Yo g

Basically, I have it so Runitall2.py is the main script that runs the other three scripts, GetAllBlockTransactions2.py, GetPrice2.py
and GetBothPrices2.py. When you run Runitall2.py it asks for tx hashes and should pass all of them
as an argument to GetAllBlockTransactions2.py and GetBothPrices2.py, as these are the only ones that need it. But when I
run the code it only does one tx hash and then ends instead of iterating through all of them.
Fix dat. safe.
